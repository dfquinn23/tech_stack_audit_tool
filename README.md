# Tech Stack Audit Tool

> **AI-powered technology audits that discover hidden automation opportunities in software your clients already own**

A production-ready consulting tool that systematically identifies valuable software updates, enhancements, and automation features released in the past 2 years that clients are paying for but not using.

## 🎯 What It Does

**For Consultants:**
- **Automated research** of software updates and new features across entire client tech stacks
- **Category-based intelligence** that scales across any tools, not just pre-programmed ones
- **50% faster audits** through systematic stage-gate methodology
- **Consistent quality** across all client engagements
- **Zero repetition** - persistent state prevents re-analyzing the same data

**For Clients:**
- **Discover hidden value** - automation features they already pay for but don't know exist
- **2-year update history** for every tool in their stack
- **Clear automation roadmap** with prioritized opportunities
- **Business impact quantification** - time savings, cost reduction, error elimination
- **Implementation guidance** for each discovered feature

## 🔍 Core Value Proposition

### The Problem
Your clients are paying for software updates and new features they don't know about. Between 2023-2025, major vendors like Microsoft, Salesforce, Zoom, and industry-specific tools (FactSet, Bloomberg, Orion, Redtail) released hundreds of workflow automation features that clients never discovered or implemented.

### The Solution
This tool automatically researches and identifies:
- **New API capabilities** for workflow automation
- **Integration enhancements** between existing tools
- **Automation features** that eliminate manual work
- **Recent updates** with business impact descriptions

### Example Output
> "You're already paying for these automation features added in the last 2 years:
> - **Microsoft 365 Power Automate Premium Connectors** (added Q2 2024): Eliminate 10 hours/week of manual data entry between Excel and your CRM
> - **FactSet API 2.0 Real-time Data Feeds** (added Q1 2024): Automate portfolio reporting, saving 5-10 hours/week
> - **Redtail CRM Email Parser** (added Q3 2023): Automatic client contact updates from email signatures
> - Here's exactly how to implement them..."

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Audit Workflow

#### 1. Prepare Client Data
Create CSV with client tools (including new `Tool Type` field):
```csv
Tool Name,Category,Used By,Criticality,Tool Type
FactSet,Research,Portfolio Management,High,research_platform
Redtail CRM,CRM,Client Services,High,crm
Microsoft 365,Productivity,All,High,productivity_suite
Orion Eclipse,Portfolio Management,PM Team,High,portfolio_management
Schwab PortfolioCenter,Portfolio Management,PM Team,High,portfolio_management
```

**Supported Tool Types:**
- `research_platform` - FactSet, Bloomberg, Morningstar, etc.
- `portfolio_management` - Orion, Addepar, Schwab PortfolioCenter, etc.
- `crm` - Redtail, Salesforce variants, Wealthbox, etc.
- `custodial` - Schwab, Fidelity, Pershing, etc.
- `financial_planning` - RightCapital, MoneyGuidePro, eMoney, etc.
- `communication` - Teams, Zoom, Slack, etc.
- `productivity_suite` - Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, etc.
- `operations` - QuickBooks, ADP, DocuSign, etc.
- `compliance` - Global Relay, Smarsh, etc.

#### 2. Create New Audit
```python
from enhanced_run_pipeline_day2 import EnhancedAuditPipelineDay2

# Initialize audit session
pipeline = EnhancedAuditPipelineDay2(
    client_name="Client Name",
    client_domain="client.com"  # Optional for auto-discovery
)
```

#### 3. Configure Research Parameters
```python
# Set custom date range for update research (default: 2 years)
pipeline.set_research_window(
    start_date="2023-10-01",  # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
    end_date="2025-10-01"
)
```

#### 4. Run Complete Audit
```python
# Execute full audit pipeline with automated research
success = await pipeline.run_complete_enhanced_audit(
    csv_path="data/client_tech_stack.csv",
    enable_update_research=True,  # Enables automated feature research
    research_depth="medium"        # Options: "quick", "medium", "deep"
)
```

#### 5. Review Generated Deliverables

**Files Created:**
- `output/audit_report_[audit_id]_[timestamp].md` - Client-ready report with all discovered updates
- `output/update_summary_[audit_id].json` - Structured data of all discovered features
- `data/audit_sessions/audit_[id].json` - Persistent audit state
- `data/research_cache/` - Cached research results (reusable)

## 🔬 Research Agent Details

### How It Works

For each tool in your client's CSV, the Research Agent:

#### Step 1: API Changelog Check
```python
# Checks known API endpoints first (fast, reliable)
- Microsoft 365: Microsoft Graph API
- Zoom: Zoom Developer Changelog
- Salesforce: Salesforce Release Updates API
- GitHub-based tools: GitHub Releases API
```

#### Step 2: Web Research (if no API available)
```python
# Intelligent web scraping
Search queries:
- "{Tool Name} product updates 2023-2025"
- "{Tool Name} new features automation"
- "{Tool Name} press releases enhancements API"

Sources checked:
- Official vendor website
- Press release pages
- Support/documentation pages
- Product blog (if exists)
```

#### Step 3: AI Analysis
```python
# Filters and analyzes findings
- Filters for automation-relevant updates
- Focuses on workflow features based on Tool Type
- Generates business impact descriptions
- Estimates time savings potential
```

### Research Depth Options

**Quick** (1-2 sources per tool, ~30 seconds/tool)
- API check + vendor homepage
- Best for: Initial scans, large tool lists (20+ tools)

**Medium** (3-4 sources per tool, ~60 seconds/tool) ⭐ **Recommended**
- API check + vendor site + press releases + support docs
- Best for: Standard audits (10-20 tools)

**Deep** (5-6 sources per tool, ~90 seconds/tool)
- All of the above + industry articles + user forums
- Best for: High-value clients, critical tool analysis

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a production consulting tool. For customizations:

1. Test thoroughly with provided test suites
2. Document new tool types or API endpoints discovered
3. Share findings to expand the API registry

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No updates found for tool X"**
- Check if tool name matches vendor's official name
- Verify Tool Type is correctly assigned
- Try "deep" research mode
- Tool may not have released updates in time window

**"Research agent timing out"**
- Reduce research depth to "quick"
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify web scraping isn't being blocked
- API rate limits may be hit (wait and retry)

**"Business impact descriptions too generic"**
- Provide more context in Tool Type definitions
- Manually refine descriptions (tool generates drafts)
- Add industry-specific keywords to research queries

### Performance Optimization

**Large Tool Lists (20+ tools):**
```python
# Use quick research mode
pipeline.run_complete_enhanced_audit(
    csv_path="data/tools.csv",
    research_depth="quick"
)
```

**Frequent Audits:**
- Research cache duration: 30 days
- Reuse cached results for tools that haven't changed
- Build up API endpoint registry over time

## 📞 Support
