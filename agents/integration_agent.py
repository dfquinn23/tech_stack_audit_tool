              **Steps**: <2-5 short steps describing the flow>
              **Value**: <why it matters / KPI impact>

            Rules:
            - ONLY reference tools that appear in the firm's stack list.
            - Prefer Microsoft 365 integrations where relevant (since 365 is in the stack).
            - If the update mentions AI summarization/transcripts (e.g., Zoom), suggest auto-filing + notifying relevant teams.
            - If custodial data (e.g., Schwab) is involved, include compliance logging or CRM enrichment (Wealth Box).
            - Keep each suggestion to ~4â€“6 lines. No fluff.
